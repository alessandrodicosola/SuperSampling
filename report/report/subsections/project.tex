\subsection{Hardware}
The following hardware is used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item GTX1060 (6 GB)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture configuration}

    \begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}

        \caption{Comparison between the training time of 1 epoch of the default configuration, using the trick and not using the trick.}\label{project:batch-time}
    \end{subfigure}

\textbf{ASDN} is using a bi-dense connection this means a lot of memory is used for storing intermediate activations as well as gradients: the default configuration, number of dense attention block 16 and number of intra connected layers 8, is not suitable for my computer.

In order to train the default configuration an implementation trick can be used (\textbf{save checkpoint}\footnote{\href{https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html}{PyTorch checkpoint}}): avoid to store gradient and activations during the forward pass and recompute them during the backward pass; but this increase the training time of a \textbf{single batch} as we can see from \Cref{project:batch-time}

Among many configurations tried [\Cref{project:random-configurations}] the final configuration chosen uses half the parameters with respect to the default configuration:
\begin{tabular}{lc}
    DABs & 8\\
    IDBs & 4\\
    Features DAB & 32 \\
    Features IDB & 32 
\end{tabular}

\subsection{The initial LR}

\begin{figure}

        \centering

        \caption{Loss values with lr: 0.01 (right), 0.001(middle), 0.0001(left)}
    \end{subfigure}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{project-val-psnr-ssim-lr.png}
        \caption{PSNR and SSIM values with lr: 0.01 (gray), 0.001 (orange), 0.0001 (blue)}        
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Experiments with different \textit{lr}.}\label{project:lr-experiments}
\end{figure}

The initial learning rate is set to \textbf{0.001} based on the experiments done (\Cref{project:lr-experiments}).
